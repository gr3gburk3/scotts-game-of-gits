House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he was betrayed by the crown.  He was made to look evil and was executed by beheading.
